<h1> Getting started with iBeacons in Swift </h1>

<p> This is a code for a tutorial on iBeacons, where you will learn the basics of Bluetooth LE, understand how to work with iBeacons, how to properly configure the devices, learn the prons and cons of Bluetooth LE and finally you will learn how to connect and use them with your application using Swift programming language for iOS. </p>
<p> The final result is the application that is able to identify all the beacons that are in your range and tell the distance from your phone and display notifications and alerts. This is an upgrade to an old tutorial I wrote for CityOS foundation with the latest Swift syntax. Link for the tutorial can be found <a href="http://nermin.tech/getting-started-ibeacons-swift/"> here </a>
